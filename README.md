A fast, stream-processing framework. Wallaroo makes it easy to react to data in real-time. By eliminating infrastructure complexity, going from prototype to production has never been simpler.

## What is Wallaroo?

When we set out to build Wallaroo, we had several high-level goals in mind:

- Create a dependable and resilient distributed computing framework
- Take care of the complexities of distributed computing "plumbing," allowing developers to focus on their business logic
- Provide high-performance & low-latency data processing
- Be portable and deploy easily (i.e., run on-prem or any cloud)
- Manage in-memory state for the application
- Allow applications to scale as needed, even when they are live and up-and-running

You can learn more about [Wallaroo][home-page] from our ["Hello Wallaroo!" blog post][hello-wallaroo-post] and the [Wallaroo overview video][overview-video].

### What makes Wallaroo unique

Wallaroo is a little different than most stream processing tools. While most require the JVM, Wallaroo can be deployed as a separate binary. This means no more jar files. Wallaroo also isn't locked to just using [Kafka](kafka-link) as a source, use any source you like. Application logic can be written in Python 2, Python 3, or Pony.

## Getting Started

Wallaroo can either be installed via [Docker, Vagrant][docker-link] or (on Linux) via our handy [Wallaroo Up command][wally-up].

As easy as:

```sh
docker pull wallaroo-labs-docker-wallaroolabs.bintray.io/release/wallaroo:latest
```

Check out our [installation options][installation-options] page to learn more.

## Usage

Once you've installed Wallaroo, Take a look at some of our examples. A great place to start are our [word_count][word_count] or [market spread][market-spread] examples in [Python](python-examples).

```python
"""
This is a complete example application that receives lines of text and counts each word.
"""
import string
import struct
import wallaroo

def application_setup(args):
    in_name, in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]
    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]

    lines = wallaroo.source("Split and Count",
                        wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_name, in_host, in_port,
                            decode_line))
    pipeline = (lines
        .to(split)
        .key_by(extract_word)
        .to(count_word)
        .to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, 
            encode_word_count)))

    return wallaroo.build_application("Word Count Application", pipeline)

@wallaroo.computation_multi(name="split into words")
def split(data):
    punctuation = " !\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~"

    words = []

    for line in data.split("\n"):
        clean_line = line.lower().strip(punctuation)
        for word in clean_line.split(" "):
            clean_word = word.strip(punctuation)
            words.append(clean_word)

    return words

class WordTotal(object):
    count = 0

@wallaroo.state_computation(name="count word", state=WordTotal)
def count_word(word, word_total):
    word_total.count = word_total.count + 1
    return WordCount(word, word_total.count)

class WordCount(object):
    def __init__(self, word, count):
        self.word = word
        self.count = count

@wallaroo.key_extractor
def extract_word(word):
    return word

@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=">I")
def decode_line(bs):
    return bs.decode("utf-8")

@wallaroo.encoder
def encode_word_count(word_count):
    output = word_count.word + " => " + str(word_count.count) + "\n"
    return output.encode("utf-8")
```
